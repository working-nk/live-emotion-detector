# live-emotion-detection

Live Emotion Detection (LDE), is used to detect emotions shown by humans on their face in real time. Using the concept of Deep Learning, a neural network more specifically a convolution neural network is trained using data of large number of images, which is used to predict emotions. This data contains different images of faces showing various emotions. Convolution neural network train from these images and a model is prepared. To feed live image to this model, so that model 
can predict emotion in real time, computer vision is used.

Technology used are Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Furthermore, all the code is written in Python programming language. 
Data used: Kaggle emotion detection challenge.
